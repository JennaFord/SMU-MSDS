# Homework for Week 6
Doing Data Science

This is the homework for week 6 with all associated files. The purpose of this assignment is to provide insight into where additional Veterans Administration (VA) medical centers should be located.

The datasets used in this assignment are listed below:
* N-MHSS-2015-DS0001-data-r.rda found [here](https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-mental-health-services-survey-2015-n-mhss-2015-ds0001-nid17098). This dataset is from a survey of every known healthcare facility that offered mental health service in the Unites States in 2015. 
* [States and their square mileage](https://github.com/BivinSadler/MSDS-6306-Doing-Data-Science/blob/master/Unit%206/statesize.csv)

In this assignment I filter the suvery data to include only data for VA medical centers that are in the mainland US. The first barchart shows the number of VA centers by state. The second barchart shows the number of VA centers by state per 1000 sq miles and color codes by region.

I also provide some recommendations for further research. I do not think there is enough information in the data provided to suggest where additional centers should be located.

For questions, please contact me at jennaf@mail.smu.edu.
