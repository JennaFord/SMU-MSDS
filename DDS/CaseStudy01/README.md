## Craft Beer Market Analysis for Budweiser

Budweiser is looking to enter the craft beer market in the United States. Our team was contacted in order to provide insight into the market to initially enter and the type of beer to produce. Budweiser also wanted to know some general information about the craft beer market.

The data provided by Budweiser for this analysis consists of 2410 US craft beers from 558 US breweries. The analysis includes the following in order to describe the current craft beer market:

* A look at the data
* Missing values for ABV & IBU measurements
* How many breweries are in each state
* Descriptive information for ABV
* Median ABV & IBU by state
* Beer with the highest ABV and beer with the highest IBU
* Correlation between ABV and IBU

With the data provided, the team concluded that there is a market for craft beer due to different styles becoming more desirable.  We highlighted the middle 50% range for ABV of 5% and 6.7% that you should aim for during production. Opportunity for growth in establishing a brewery could be sought in states where there is already a footprint established or trending in that direction based off of the number of breweries by state. However, we think more research needs to be done with respect to beer consumption by style and state to narrow down the beer style Budweiser wants to produce and the market they want to enter first.
